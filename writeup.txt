Loose Notes - Experiments

- Source activate rather than conda activate is required in VS code to get right env in terminal and interpreter.

- installed XG boost via conda due to setup errors on pip (could be down to local env)

- https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/403972/the-python-command-starts-the-the-wrong-version-of-the-python-interpreter
    - Py 2.7 seems hashed, as VS code calling wrong env.
    - didn’t fix it, but cleared hash anyway.

- Switched to VM to determine if that will resolve env issues.

- in VM switching interpreter does indeed switch py version when doing through GUI and printing version to verify.

- conda activate [name] worked in terminal.

- install xgboost worked in VM

- need to switch interpreter in GUI and in terminal to match up, or use one or the other as needed (best to be consistent)

- in new conda env, make sure jupyter is installed OR it falls back on base version

- installing onyx with pip caused issues - some other dependency didn’t come with it, or did not work (bug)

- for XGB the ‘xgb.XGBClassifier’ is an SK learn interface, whereas the other is the original, sk being recommended.

- ONNX Is a standard, but ONNX converting tools appear weak - bumping into errors and disparate approaches and maintenance teams.
    - error indicates its not the mltools but onyx itself not containing a piece of code the tool needs.
    - version mismatch?
    - https://github.com/onnx/onnx
        - this could suggests some sense of incorrect install order, I just pip installed I believe without looking at this ^^

- When changing env and testing for working … do it in terminal, jupyter will need reset each time

- noted that forgetting about mltool, onyx itself does not import - indicating a root error in the lib I am using.

- noted terminal was not matching the env…
    - NOTE!!!!! onnx imports in IDE but not terminal… term and ideally are different… WHHHHYYYYYY…
        - Lets NOT use the terminal?
        - NNOOOO its due to me doing some global installs

- killed env, created fresh - seems onyx was installed globally somehow in any case.

- using latest version of onyx - 1.5

- onyx ml tools is at 1.3.1 rather than 1.5 … NOTE
    - DID NOT help

https://github.com/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/16
- this seems to suggest install could be a windows issue of some kind, specific env variable.
- Seems to indicate only occuring from source install, which I may have installed globally.

- tried again on mac
    - that issue seems a VS code issue - does not occur in terminal
    - ie in vs code terminal python 2.7 always executes instead of 3.x

MAC solution: you install packages in default terminal, IDE PATH seems to have an issue with VS code.

- THIS WILL ENABLE TESTING - so it was  VS code ‘issue’ or PATH sitting mess which VS code could not resolve for terminal, ie could not pip install in IDE

FOR WINDOWS WILL NEED TO RESET THE VM SOMEHOW.

- defines data types read in by the ml tools - https://github.com/microsoft/onnxconverter-common
    - https://github.com/microsoft/onnxconverter-common/blob/master/onnxconverter_common/data_types.py

- It works! on mac, need to understand how I can bundle vectorisation into the onnx model


- Need to think about pros and cons of seperate vectoriser if we cant pipeline XGB with ONNX and vectorisation sk learn.
    - IE can we use sk learn converter with XGB?
    - or a combo of both? convert XGB and THEN use that in a pipeline... maybe.

- Need to reset VM and windows attempt

- Now trying with pipeline and sk converter with XGB   
    - not using text, just building a two layer pipeline.

- XGboost does not work 'out of the box with sk learn onnx, need to register differently.
